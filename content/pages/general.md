There is some general info about ratty diet that everyone 
should know about:  

### Moderation Is Key   

Just like for humans a good diet is 
one that is moderated and varied. Rats love food, 
their wild cousins can eat pretty much anything and get away with it and 
pet rats are almost as resilient too! However rats life-span heavily 
depend on their diet, so having a varied and moderated diet will 
increase the quality and quantity of ratty's life drastically!

Some foods are more heavy than other and might upset your ratty's stomach. 
If it happens - it's nothing to worry about, ratty might retreat to a 
corner or safe place and take some time to digest the food. 
Obviously the animal is not too happy about it, so through observation 
these foods can be identified and reduced.

### Sugars

Just like for every animal sugar is not healthy for ratties and should 
be avoided if possible. Home ratties can easily get overweight and sugar
contributes to this a lot. Of course it's ok to treat a ratty with 
a piece of cookie once in a while, but sugar intake should be heavily
moderated for a healthy diet.

### Wash Everything

Just like you'd wash your own food ratty food should not be an exception. 
Since rats are very small they are more susceptible to various pesticides,
so naturally getting rid of unhealthy particles matter more here.
